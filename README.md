Create HTML webpage with a dynamic table to show data on UFO sightings



### Purpose:
##### The purpose of this analysis is to create a webpage that allows users to view data on UFO sightings. Users can filter the data by date, city, state, country, and shape. This analysis also provides instructions on how to navigate the webpage.


### Results:
##### Users can view the webpage [here](https://eoweed.github.io/UFOs/).

##### All the UFO data is displayed in a table, and there are input boxes to filter the data. Once a filter is added, the page will refresh showing only data that matches the filters. 

##### For example, if a user wanted to view all UFO sightings in Arizona:
##### -	type “ar” into the “Enter State” input box.

##### If they wanted to view all UFO sightings in California on January 1st, 2010, in the shape of a triangle:
##### -	type “1/1/2010” into the “Enter Date” input box.
##### -	type “ca” into the “Enter State” input box.
##### -	type “triangle” into the “Enter Shape” input box.

##### To clear the filters, the user must refresh the page or delete the items from the input box.



### Summary:
##### This webpage provides an easy way to view UFO sightings data in a dynamic format. However, one drawback is that you must refresh the webpage or manually delete the items from the input boxes in order to clear filters. Also, if a user misspells something, no data will show. Two improvements could be to allow users to select filters from a drop-down menu, and to include a button that will clear filters more easily.
